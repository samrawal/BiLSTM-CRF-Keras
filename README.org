* Named Entity Recognition with BiLSTM-CRF in Keras 
** Overview
This repository contains an implementation of a BiLSTM-CRF network in Keras for performing Named Entity Recognition (NER). This implementation was created with the goals of allowing *flexibility* through configuration options that do not require significant changes to the code each time, and simple, robust *logging* to keep tabs on model performances without extra effort.

- Model parameters are exposed through a JSON config file for easy configuration.
- Supports automatic logging of train/test results, model parameters, etc. across multiple trials
- Supports initializing embedding layer with weights from pretrained word2vec model (optional)

Inspired by Guillaume Genthial's [[https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/sequence_tagging][LSTM+CRF Tensorflow implementation]], and following the completion of my [[https://repository.asu.edu/items/48493][Honors Undergraduate Thesis]], I decided to create my own implementation of a BiLSTM-CRF model that would provide flexibility, while providing easy model logging and configuration without needing to make significant changes in the code each time.

** Model
This is an implementation of the BiLSTM-CRF architecture described in [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360][Lample et al.]] Both character- and word-level representations are used for the input. Additionally, the word-level embedding layer can be initialized with pretrained word2vec model weights.
